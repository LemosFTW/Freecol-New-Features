-> Smell: Data Class
    Looks good for me.

-> Smell: Divergent Class
   Doesn´t seem that there is a code smell of Divergent Class here, since the class appears to do what it says it is puosed to do, but it might be a case of Seculative generality as it is not used anywhere in the code.

-> Smell: Long method
    Correctly identified code smell and accurate description. There is nothing to change, good work.
