As a new player, I want to have a quick explanation of each new action I unlock while exploring, so that I can understand what is possible to do

As an experienced player, I want to see caves as a new map square that can have a treasure or a trap, so that I can have more risk/reward situations

As an experienced player, I want to be able to invade and claim enemy ships, so that I can grow my colony even faster
