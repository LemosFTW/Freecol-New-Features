As an experienced player, I want to be able to claim enemy ships, so that I
can grow my colony even faster. (Rodrigo Lemos) (Rodrigo Suzana)



- When we are in conflict with another boat, we want to win the conflict and conquer the boat, so that we can get the boat's resources and gain another boat.

1- find the class who leeds to the boat conflict
2- create a method that will ask the player if he wants the boat, after winning the conflict





Classses que eu acho que estao relacionadas com nossa userStory:
- ServerApi.java : tem o metodo attack que pode ser interessante para alterarmos
- Unit.java
- UnitType.java
- ServerUnit.java
- AttackMessage.java?????? -> Penso que nao tenha que ver com isto

Da wiki: Naval units and Artillery can not be promoted. A beaten artillery unit becomes a Damaged Artillery, which can not be repaired and will be destroyed if it loses another battle. "Ships are either sunk or damaged when they lose a battle". In either case all units and cargo aboard the ship are lost, and the ship automatically returns to the nearest repair location. This may be one of your colonies with a Drydock or the Home Port. 

"Ships are either sunk or damaged when they lose a battle" este metodo pode ser encontrado na classe SimpleCombatModel.java chama-se resolveAttack(Unit winner, Unit loser ...)
Tem esta parte do codigo:


if (loser.isNaval()) {
            // Naval victors get to loot the defenders hold.  Sink the
            // loser on great win/loss, lack of repair location, or
            // beached.
            if (winner.isNaval() && winner.canCaptureGoods()
                && !loser.getGoodsList().isEmpty()) {
                crs.add(CombatEffectType.LOOT_SHIP);
            }
            if (great || loserMustDie
                || loser.getRepairLocation() == null
                || loser.isBeached()) {
                crs.add(CombatEffectType.SINK_SHIP_ATTACK);
            } else {
                crs.add(CombatEffectType.DAMAGE_SHIP_ATTACK);
            }

Talves em great win/loss acrescentar metodo que adiciona a ship do inimigo a frota?
