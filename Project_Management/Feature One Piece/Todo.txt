As an experienced player, I want to be able to claim enemy ships, so that I
can grow my colony even faster. (Rodrigo Lemos) (Rodrigo Suzana)



- When we are in conflict with another boat, we want to win the conflict and conquer the boat, so that we can get the boat's resources and gain another boat.

1- find the class who leeds to the boat conflict
2- create a method that will ask the player if he wants the boat, after winning the conflict
