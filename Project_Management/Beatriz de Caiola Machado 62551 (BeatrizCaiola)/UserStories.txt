- as an experienced player, I want to have a feature that allows me to select and move multiple units at once, in order to save time moving large numbers of units to the same place

- as a player, I want to be capable of disabling the feature that automatically selects a free unit after ordering a unit, as a way to avoid having the camera jump around the map

- as a history enthusiast, I want there to be gunpowder in the game, used in firearms as a way to make the combat feel more authentic
