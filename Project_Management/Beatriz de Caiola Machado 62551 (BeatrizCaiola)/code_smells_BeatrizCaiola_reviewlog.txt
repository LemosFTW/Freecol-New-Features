-> Smell: Message Chains 
   The code smell is accurate and precise, however the snippet is too long and it's hard to identify exactly where the message chains are.

-> Smell: Long Method
The code smell identification is correct and the solution is good, but it could be a bit more precise on where the code devision would be made.

-> Smell: Duplicated Code
   It isn't the clearest example at first glance, but the explanation does make it very much understandable and the suggested solution fits the problem. Great job!
