-> Pattern: Adapter pattern
   This pattern is not an adapter pattern, by the description it sounds like a proxy pattern, but 
   it needs rechecking. There are also no code snippets for any of the patterns.

-> Pattern: Singleton pattern
   Pattern looks like the described but description is too vague? Maybe because 
   of the lack of code snippets.

-> Pattern: Template pattern
   Correctly identified code smell and accurate description. There is nothing to change, good work.
