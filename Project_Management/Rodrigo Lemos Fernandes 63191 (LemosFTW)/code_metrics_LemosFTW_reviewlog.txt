As a good project should be, the coupling factor is low, this indicates that there is not a high dependency between the classes,
also the inheritance factor is high(both method and attribute), this indicates that the classes are well designed and the inheritance is used in a good way.
The polymorphism factor is low, this indicates that the classes are not using polymorphism, this is not a bad thing to have in a big project.
The method hiding factor is low, this indicates that the methods are not hidden, this is bad, allowing other classes to see methods that could be encapsulated.
The attribute hiding factor is high, this indicates that the attributes are hidden, this is good, allowing other classes to see only the attributes that are needed.
